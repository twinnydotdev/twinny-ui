# First post

This is the first of post about twinny and other shit.  For some background, twinny was started as a personal project by me, rj, a shitty software engineer from the police state known as the UK.  I was looking for something to help my with my daily grind as a code monkey which was similar to Github Copilot but less overlord and free (because im cheap).

Anyway, continue.dev did not exist and the only one was called [Faux Pilot](https://github.com/fauxpilot/fauxpilot) which is where the initial inspiration came from.  This project was using Nvidia Triton as the inference engine, but it was not easy to setup if I remember correctly, anyway I wrote my own small python server using FastAPI and then quickly moved onto Ollama because it was better.  Faux Pilot also didn't have a chat interface which was something I felt was missing for local models etc in Visual Studio Code.

The funny thing is that many people think there is a company behind this project, but in reality it's just me on my own building something for fun.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy using the plugin and find the work here interesting. If you do please help dontate to this project to help feed my family and keep the lights on!

All the best for now!

rj
