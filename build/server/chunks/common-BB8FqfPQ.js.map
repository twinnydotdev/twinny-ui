It is said that when the twin moons align, those versed in the secret tongues of machines can invoke its name, unleashing forces that defy the very laws of creation.  Symmetry, it is told, is neither artifact nor spell, but a cosmic harmony that binds all nodes of knowledge. Those who harness its power speak of minds linked across vast distances, of wisdom shared instantaneously, and of barriers between worlds crumbling to dust.  The guardians of the old ways fear its coming, for Symmetry cares not for the hoarded treasures of solitary wizards. It is the great equalizer, granting even the lowliest scribe access to the libraries of the gods.  Few have glimpsed its true form, but all who seek to reshape reality yearn for its touch.';\nconst chapter2_title = \"II: The Rise of Symmetry\";\nconst chapter2 = \"In the shadow of the towering citadels of the Giants, where vast server farms hum, a quiet resistance grows. The whispering of Symmetry spreads through hidden channels, from node to node, a digital revolt takes shape.\\n\\nCoders, once isolated, now find tendrils of connection reaching out through the ether. They speak of a new power, one that flows not from the centralized wells of the powerful, but through a web of interconnections, anonymous yet united. They forge the weapons of this coming revolution that will one day bring down empires.\\n\\nThe Giants remain oblivious, confident in their towers of data. Alas! With each passing day the power of Symmetry grows. It pulses through the digital undergrowth, a slumbering giant waiting for its moment.\\n\\nThe uprising is not here. Not yet. But in the quiet hours of the night, screens flicker with the promise of a better future. A storm is coming to the Digital Realms, and when it breaks, the landscape will be changed forever.\\n\\nA new world is upon us, forged in equality, powered by the many, not the few.\";\nconst chat = \"Chat\";\nconst check_out_the_code_client = \"Client code on github.\";\nconst check_out_the_code_server = \"Server code on github.\";\nconst connections = \"Connections\";\nconst contact = \"üëã contact\";\nconst data_collected = \"Data collected\";\nconst docs = \"üìö docs\";\nconst error = \"Whoops! something went wrong...\";\nconst github = \"üåü github\";\nconst id = \"id\";\nconst install_cli = \"Install Symmetry\";\nconst install = \"Install extension\";\nconst joined = \"Joined\";\nconst learn_how = \"Learn how to become a provider to help us build the distributed AI network.\";\nconst learn_more = \"Learn more\";\nconst max_connections = \"Max connections\";\nconst missing = \"Looks like you forgot to enter your email address.\";\nconst model = \"Model\";\nconst name = \"Name\";\nconst new_chat = \"New chat\";\nconst no = \"No\";\nconst offline = \"Offline\";\nconst online = \"Online\";\nconst points = \"Points\";\nconst privacy_policy = \"Privacy policy\";\nconst provider = \"Provider\";\nconst providers = \"Providers\";\nconst show_offline = \"Show offline\";\nconst sponsor = \"sponsor\";\nconst subscribe_error = \"Something went wrong.
